# FAQ
#### How often are new bounties added to the list?
The list of bounties is updated after every season. Season 1 was launched during Q4-2022. Rules have slightly changed since the beginning of Season 3, and we there will be one bounty for each Zama library. But, we encourage anyone to submit [a bounty proposition](#want-to-work-on-something-else-submit-a-bounty-proposition).

#### How long will it take to get my submission reviewed?
We are reviewing most of the submissions at the end of every seasons. But feel free to submit your code at any time [here](https://zama.ai/bounty-program-register-and-submit).

#### How are bounties reviewed?
Every bounty solution is reviewed as a code submission. If the code does not meet the quality or the performance expected, the proposition will be rejected, or partially rewarded.

#### What is the reward?
Each bounty created by the team at Zama is attributed a total envelop of ‚Ç¨15,000 for rewards.

#### ü•áBest submission: up to ‚Ç¨10,000.
To be considered best submission, a solution must be efficient, effective and demonstrate a deep understanding of the core problem. Alongside the technical correctness, it should also be submitted with a clean code, clear explanations and a complete documentation.

#### ü•àSecond-best submission: up to ‚Ç¨3,500.
For a solution to be considered the second best submission, it should be both efficient and effective. The code should be neat and readable, while its documentation might not be as exhaustive as the best submission, it should cover the key aspects of the solution.

#### ü•âThird-best submission: up to ‚Ç¨1,500.
The third best submission is one that presents a solution that effectively tackles the challenge at hand, even if it may have certain areas of improvement in terms of efficiency or depth of understanding. Documentation should be present, covering the essential components of the solution.
